react was built with philosophy to manipualte DOMs efficiently
Manipulating DOMs is the most expensive operation by browsers. react trie to solve that using javascript
React can be written without JSX also.
if you change the order of script in html file - for ex: write App.js before importing react cdn, it will throw an error
ORDER of the files are important
React is called both library and a framework. Its library coz it can be applioed to a small section of html page as well
that's a good thing abt react that you dont need to build whole App with react.
